#### Explanation of Purpose

Atomix Settings Manager Pro (My Solution), Is a system utility/toolkit for windows 10/11. It allows the user to access more advanced and hidden settings/tweaks which aren't available from within the built in settings app. It also allows the user to manage the programs that open on startup in a more robust and controlled way than the Task Manager App that comes with windows. AtomixSMP Also provides a simple, yet stylish user interface which is consistent and familiar to the user as modeled after the Windows 11 Settings app so most users would already have an understanding for the Interface and allows the Program to act and feel like an Extension upon the Operating system and less like a third party tool.
