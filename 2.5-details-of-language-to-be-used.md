<summary>C# -> Core Programming Language (Back End)</summary>

C#: Object Orientated, High Level Code Compilation, Extensible Framework, Massive Online Support.

* VB.Net
  * At first was considering using VB.Net as it was super familiar to me, Object Orientated and Light Weight. however i ultimately decided against VB.Net mainly due to its dated user interface and severe lack of Support for modern UI Libraries.
* C++
  * C++ was my next candidate as it has a plethora of modern UI Libraries available, Lots of Online Resources But i mainly considered it because i have seen most similar solutions using C++ so i thought it was good for this type of thing. I discarded C++ as it looked way too difficult to learn and i don't need super low level compilation for my solution.
* C# (C Sharp)
  * C# Is Basically C++ but higher level compilation, more object orientated and easier to learn. I ended up choosing C# as my main programming language as its basically designed for making my type of solution. I Coupled C# with some other languages which although aren't "Programing Languages" in the traditional sense, they are relevant as they are part of what makes my implementation slightly different from standard C#.

<summary>XAML -> User Interface Styling (Front End)</summary>

* XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language)
  * Although XAML Isn't classified as a programing language it responsible for every aspect of how my User Interface Looks and Feels. Think of it as The HTML/CSS of C#. C# is handling the back end, XAML is handling the front end (design, layout, style). I didnt have allot of choice here as the UI Library im using is dependent on XAML + C#.
